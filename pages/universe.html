<h1>The Universe</h1>

<p>
  The word Universe derives from the Latin universum. The Latin word was used by
  Cicero and later by other authors with the same meaning as it is used today.
  The Latin word is derived from the poetic contraction unvorsum — first used by
  Lucretius in Book IV of his “On the Nature of Things” — which connects un, uni
  (one) with vorsum, versum (which means "something rotated, rolled or changed"
  ).
